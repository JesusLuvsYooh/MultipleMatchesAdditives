# MultipleMatchesAdditives
 An all in one multiple match project, with list server, join by id, matchmaking with options and more.

## Headless server and client args:

/Users/pathToFile -mode client -frameRate 15 -ip -port 7777

/Users/pathToFile -mode server -frameRate 60 -port 7777 -maxConnections 101 -maxMatches 10 -maxPlayersPerMatch 2

## ToDo:
- Tidy up.
- Add comments and tooltips.
- HasSpaceInServer() does not take into consideration matchmaking map?
- Ban list ip/device.
